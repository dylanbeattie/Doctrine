    <h2>Typographic Elements</h2>
    <p>Doctrine doesn't impose any style at all - your CSS, markup and presentation are entirely yours. What it does is to extract the head and body elements from your standalone HTML pages and inject them into the head and body sections of a master page.</p>
    <h2 name="h2-getting-started">What is Doctrine?</h2>
    <p>Doctrine runs as part of an ASP.NET MVC website. You write HTML pages; Doctrine generates navigation, headers and footers for you.</p>
    <p>It's not a content management system - it's for people who are happy writing HTML and want an easy way to make it look good.</p>
