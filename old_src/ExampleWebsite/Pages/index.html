    <h1>Doctrine: Super-Simple Documentation</h1>
    <h2 name="h2-getting-started">What is Doctrine?</h2>
    <p>Doctrine runs as part of an ASP.NET MVC website. You write HTML pages; Doctrine generates navigation, headers and footers for you.</p>
    <p>It's not a content management system - it's for people who are happy writing HTML and want an easy way to make it look good.</p>
