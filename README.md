# Doctrine

Doctrine is a lightweight content presentation system built on ASP.NET MVC. You supply content as standalone HTML files. Doctrine parses your HTML content,
extracts information about headings, links and document structure, and provides a set of data structures you can use to style your content, apply common headers and footers, 
build tables of contents,
nagivation and so on. No database. No dependencies. Just content and code.
